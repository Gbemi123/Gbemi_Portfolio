# [Project 1: Detection of lane markings for autonomous vehicles](https://github.com/Gbemi123/Lane-marking-detection)
- Created a lane detection model for autonomous vehicle
- Model uses MatLab image processing libraries for edge detection and image processing
- Repositions vehicle based on the lane markings to centre it
- Model Tested on images and videos
