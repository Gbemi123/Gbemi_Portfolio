An optimization and computer graphics project that involved the use of the computer graphics library ODAK
to ray trace a simulation of looking through an AR optical component made up of pinholes. The component is 
then optimized with PyTorch by stochastic gradient descent. The result was a 96% reduction in error between 
the initially rendered images and the optimized images.


# [Project 2: Detection of lane markings for autonomous vehicles](https://github.com/Gbemi123/Lane-marking-detection)
- Created a lane detection model for autonomous vehicle
- Model uses MatLab image processing libraries for edge detection and image processing
- Repositions vehicle based on the lane markings to centre it
- Model Tested on images and videos

# [Project 3: Poisson image editing](https://github.com/Gbemi123/Poisson-Editing)

Poisson image editing is a technique used to seamlessly blend together 2 images without artefacts. It is a type of digital image processing that operates on the differences between neighboring pixels, rather than on the pixel values directly. Poisson blending aims to copy the gradients of the source image into the destination image. 


# [Project 4: Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks for generating Pokemon](https://gakinolaalli.medium.com/generating-pokemon-with-dcgans-deep-convolutional-generative-adversarial-networks-79407630c10a)

DCGANs are an updated version of generative adversarial networks that include the use of 
deep convolutional layers. Using this technique, I created a model that generates new images
of popular show characters known as Pok√©mon based on a dataset on Kaggle containing
images of existing characters. [Code](https://github.com/Gbemi123/DCGAN-for-generating-pokemon)



# [Project 5: Classifying Emotions](https://github.com/Gbemi123/Classifying-Emotions)

This project uses convolutional neural networks(CNN) and a Kaggle dataset with images of faces with various emotions to create a web app capable of classifying the user's feelings.
The web app is hosted via Streamlit and the user can upload an image of their face and receive a prediction of a feeling based on that image. Below are some images from the dataset used for testing with the predicted (pred) and actual labels (label) shown


# [Project 6: Generating Clothes Images with MNIST fashion dataset and GAN's](https://gakinolaalli.medium.com/generative-adversarial-networks-gans-with-mnist-fashion-dataset-42b076112a06)

A generative AI project that uses an unsupervised deep learning algorithm known as the generative Adversarial network. The popular computer vision dataset MNIST fashion dataset was used to train the model and the model generated images that were distinguishable from MNIST images.
